## How to use
- Pick a category and idea, add a short issue with acceptance criteria.
- Prototype small (happy path + one edge case) before generalizing.
- Prefer plugin-factory patterns to allow options and per-view scoping.


## Wrap-up
This list is intentionally broad; pick 10–20 high-value ideas and I can help prototype one or two fully (code + tests + README) in the next session.
